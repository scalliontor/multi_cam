# RealSense Dual-Camera Extrinsic Calibration

A simple system for calibrating the extrinsic parameters between two Intel RealSense cameras using 3D-to-3D point cloud alignment with ChArUco board detection.

## üéØ Overview

This calibration system uses the **Kabsch algorithm** to find the optimal rigid body transformation between two RealSense cameras by:
1. Detecting ChArUco board corners in both cameras
2. Converting 2D corners to 3D points using depth information
3. Finding the optimal rotation and translation using 3D-to-3D alignment
4. Validating the calibration with clean visual feedback

## üìã Requirements

### Hardware
- 2x Intel RealSense cameras with depth capability (tested with D435/D455)
- ChArUco calibration board (A4 paper, 7x5 squares)

### Software
```bash
pip install pyrealsense2 opencv-python numpy
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup
```bash
python setup.py
```
This creates the ChArUco board configuration and generates a printable board image.

### Step 2: Find Camera Serial Numbers
```bash
python find_camera.py
```
This will display your connected RealSense cameras and their serial numbers.

### Step 3: Update Camera Serial Numbers
Edit `calculate_extrinsics.py` and `check_inference.py` with your camera serial numbers:
```python
PC_CAMERA_SN = "YOUR_CAMERA_1_SERIAL"   # Primary camera
RGB_CAMERA_SN = "YOUR_CAMERA_2_SERIAL"  # Secondary camera
```

### Step 4: Print ChArUco Board
Print the generated `charuco_board_A4.png` on A4 paper. Make sure to print at 100% scale (no scaling).

### Step 5: Perform Calibration
```bash
python calculate_extrinsics.py
```

**Instructions:**
- Position the printed ChArUco board so it's visible in both cameras
- Press **'c'** to capture a view when the board is clearly detected
- Capture **5-10 views** from different angles and distances
- Press **'q'** when done to calculate extrinsics

### Step 6: Validate Calibration
```bash
python check_inference.py
```

**What to look for:**
- **Green dots** = Points detected directly in the RGB camera
- **Red dots** = Points projected from the PC camera using calibration
- **Good calibration** = Green and red dots overlap closely
- Press **'q'** to quit

## üîß Coordinate Systems

The system uses **color-aligned coordinate systems** for consistency:
- **Calibration**: Uses color intrinsics for 3D point calculation
- **Validation**: Uses the same coordinate system for projection
- **Transformation**: PC camera ‚Üí RGB camera coordinate system

## üìä Quality Assessment

| Error Range | Quality | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| < 5mm       | ‚úÖ Excellent | Ready for production |
| 5-15mm      | ‚úÖ Good | Acceptable for most applications |
| 15-30mm     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable | Consider recalibration |
| > 30mm      | ‚ùå Poor | Recalibration required |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues
- **"No cameras found"**: Ensure both RealSense cameras are connected
- **"Config file missing"**: Run `python setup.py` first

### Calibration Issues
- **"Not enough common corners"**: 
  - Reposition board to be visible in both cameras
  - Improve lighting, avoid glare
  - Keep board distance between 0.5-1.5m

### Validation Issues  
- **Green/Red dots don't align**:
  - Poor calibration - recapture with more diverse views
  - Wrong camera serial numbers
  - Print board at wrong scale (must be 100%)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

The system uses the **Kabsch algorithm** for optimal 3D-to-3D rigid body alignment:
1. Find centroids of both 3D point clouds
2. Compute cross-covariance matrix  
3. Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
4. Calculate optimal rotation and translation

**Key Features:**
- Uses color-aligned coordinate systems for consistency
- Handles proper unit conversion (meters ‚Üî millimeters)
- Robust to outliers through multiple view averaging

## üí° Tips for Best Results

- **Print board accurately**: Use 100% scale, no margins
- **Good lighting**: Avoid glare and shadows on the board
- **Stable mounting**: Prevent camera movement during calibration
- **Multiple views**: Capture 5-10 views from different angles
- **Appropriate distance**: Keep board 0.5-1.5m from cameras
